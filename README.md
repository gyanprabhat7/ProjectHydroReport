# Project Hydro Report 

## Team: TechSmiths

**Problem Statement:** A mobile app that crowd sources water-related problems from around a community, open sources data, etc. and display them on a map.
 
 In many communities, water-related problems like flooding, water quality issues in ponds/lakes, urban flooding, and drainage problems often go unreported or face significant delays in response due to a lack of efficient reporting systems. Additionally, gathering ground-level information about these issues can be challenging.

**Our Solution:** HydroReport is a mobile application designed to address the above problem by providing a user-friendly platform for citizens to report water-related problems in their communities. The app harnesses the power of crowdsourcing and utilizes it to improve disaster and crisis management related to water issues.
